q3 

a) 1 pill only, drug reaches dt instantaneosly

 time to dissipate around 10 hrs, reasonable

 in track continual decrease, in blood a peak increase and then dissipation

imp points to solve - Sir verified

Q2 c) regular intervals - so discrete dose(pill) at regular intervals
Q3 d) continuous at all times (So in rate constant C=3)
Q3 e) dosage 1/2 hr continuous every 6 hours, like pulse waveform

Q4 'I' is just a placeholder in the equation

in a) use 14N/10C as init condition, and I is 0 in rate equation,
 	   daru pyali ekda then observe.

b) I will be like C, so assume drinking continuosly.
