Q1

Part 1 - constant p

Exponen type function, saturates to C.

p decides how fast the adopta takes place

p =0.9 -> steep
p = 0.1 -> gentle

Part 2

logistic with inflection

as q increases -> the steepness increses. ie rise to saturation increases.  
q is the rate of adoptation, if it is too high it there is a drastic adoptation
So point of inflection is not clearly seen. It looking like curve in plot 1.

Assumes that information spreads only from adopted to non adopted. No extrenal influence ie other sources of information 

Part 3

mixture of both

p param dominant as it contributes to exp

->>>>>>>>>>>>> Also plot the new users at each instant, e.g N(t+dt)- N(t)
