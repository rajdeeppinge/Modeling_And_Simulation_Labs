for abs condition the diffusion seems less. 

Something is constraining the temp spread in the abs condition.

key word- abs state is "well ventilated"

in reflec case the boundaries are similar to the condi at edge
so as edges get hotter, the bouddary also gets hotter. SO though
it wont have much effect on the delta, it at least does not decrease it.

however in abs case, the boudary always stays at 25 as if it never heats up
in that case for the edge cells(of the actual grid), the boudary will always 
take away some heat act in a negative way, this is not a neutral bouddary condi
it actively takes a part in cooling it down.

the heat and cold sources have actually been impleme as absorbing points because
their temp also stays the same always.

it is impartially present between hot and cold. Now if we set if such that 
it helps the hot or cold regions the result will be diff.

conc- abs condi has a lot of effect on simula. That is what the 0,25,50 as abs
is trying to prove. 

for abs 50, it is as if we have placed the rod in between square grid heater
heating it up from all four sides. Quickly reaches equi at t=50. The cold sink
is not able to survive the heat onslaught from all the 4 sides. The breadth 
heats up first to 50 and slowly the it spreads along the length.

In weighted filer don't we have to take difference while wieghting it?
How can we simply add some fraction of the neigbour's T? If we do that 
even a colder block will be contribu to the inctease in your weight.

Res- insetad of adding the weighted temp diff, directly take new temp of cell
     as the weighted average of the neighbours. cold will infulence by red its temp
	 neg and hot will inc it.
