
Q1: approach 2, also check the large number of times we are running for the ensemble.
	Plot it to see for many are necessary for the ensemble to converge.
	
	Imp this is remaining.
	
	ie do for 10,100,1e3
	
	Change the plot axes

	Sir reco: pick an interesting project but which is not too exotic. Keep it simple.
			   
			  Sir recommends doing cellular automata or probabilistic modelling.
			  Rate equations and its analysis can be used as non lin project!!! [combina possible].
