q3 

a) 1 pill only, drug reaches dt instantaneosly

 time to dissipate around 10 hrs, reasonable

 in track continual decrease, in blood a peak increase and then dissipation

imp points to solve - Sir verified

Q2 c) regular intervals - so discrete dose(pill) at regular intervals

Q3 d) continuous at all times (So in rate constant C=3)

Obs- -> x saturates after a point, not that derivative is pos but decreasing
     -> once x saturates, y behaves exactly like x's rate behaviour, equa becomes same
	 -> there is a point of inflection in y, bcoz of competing rates, init y is less, so rate of y 
	    is increasing, but then the increasing y begins to choke it until it reaches a saturation point.
		Doubt in the fp reached for y.
		
Q3 e) dosage 1/2 hr continuous every 6 hours, like pulse waveform, use matlab repmat function
 
Q3 f) saturates around 10 not harmful
 
Q3 g) saturates around 8 not harmful


Q4 'I' is just a placeholder in the equation

in a) use 14N/10C as init condition, and I is 0 in rate equation,
 	   daru pyali ekda then observe.
	   
	-> if y>>>M then y' is independent of y!   
	-> potentially strange behaviour
	
	obs-> man w 80 empty stomach - dizzy
	      y plays a part as y not >>> M, so usual behaviour
		  
		  neg slope constant more of less coz k3 mult is very less and more or less same from 0.06 to 0.01

		  for woman intake conc is lesser (coz of higher volume) and outflow is lesser, against what is normally 
		  expected
		  
		  for average male(80) female(65) weight, the behaviour is more or less same as C is similar

		  the model suggests the more weight you have less drunk you are but for longer time, as I is dep on weight
		
		  for larger drink here 10, y becomes around 50 times larger than M for a longer time,
		  x decreases faster
		  so for a significant time, y gets a constant negative slope.
		  
		  
		b) I will be like C, so assume drinking continuosly. 

           x saturates to a const, y large enough so sec term in ydot too sats,
		   so bal rises unbounded.
		   
		   can we make a sit in which x does not saturate?
