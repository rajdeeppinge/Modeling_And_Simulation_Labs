Exposed means have contrac disease but not infec yet

sus can be quarantined 

quaran has 2 groups, sus_quaran (put in quaran but healthy), exp_quaran( are exposed but can't be detected yet).

exposed_quaran will eventaully become infectious, so they are moved to isolated, they may either die or recover but they will not spread infection.

sus who are not quarantined are in danger of infec. Doubt: who will be quarantined?

undected exposed are called exposed, as detected exposed have been handled in quarantined_exposed.

Exposed people (undec) will become infectious.

Infectious people spread the infection, they either die, recover or are detected as having disease. 
If detected here, they are immediately isolated.
